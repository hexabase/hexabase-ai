# Organization Service Testing Summary

## Test Coverage: 80.4%

### Test Structure

The test file (`service_test.go`) follows the TDD approach and includes:

1. **Mock Implementations**
   - `MockRepository` - Mocks all organization repository methods
   - `MockAuthRepository` - Mocks authentication-related operations
   - `MockBillingRepository` - Mocks billing-related operations

2. **Test Categories**

### Not Tested (Not in Service Interface)
- ❌ LogActivity (0%) - Internal method, not part of the service interface
- ❌ GetActivityLogs (0%) - Internal method, not part of the service interface

### Test Patterns Used

1. **Table-driven tests** with subtests for different scenarios
2. **Mock expectations** with precise matching
3. **Comprehensive error scenarios**
4. **Edge case handling** (empty values, nil checks)
5. **Business logic validation** (role hierarchy, ownership rules)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests
go test ./internal/service/organization -v

# Run with coverage
go test ./internal/service/organization -cover

# Generate coverage report
go test ./internal/service/organization -coverprofile=coverage.out
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Key Testing Principles Applied

1. **Isolation**: Each test is independent with its own mocks
2. **Clarity**: Clear test names describing the scenario
3. **Coverage**: Both happy paths and error scenarios
4. **Assertions**: Comprehensive checks on results and mock calls
5. **TDD Approach**: Tests written to validate business logic

### Areas for Potential Improvement

1. Add integration tests with real repositories
2. Add benchmark tests for performance-critical operations
3. Test concurrent access scenarios
4. Add more edge cases for list operations with pagination
