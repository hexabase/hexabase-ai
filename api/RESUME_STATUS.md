# Resume Status - Test Coverage Improvement

## Date: 2025-01-10

## Overall Progress
- Started with 8.5% test coverage
- Achieved 24.4% test coverage
- Fixed multiple compilation errors across test files

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Compilation Errors
- ✅ Fixed JSON unmarshal issues in application repository tests
- ✅ Fixed handler test interface mismatches
- ✅ Fixed aiops repository SQL query expectations
- ✅ Fixed billing repository test compilation errors (field name mismatches)
- ✅ Fixed logs repository test compilation errors (ClickHouse interface issues)
- ✅ Fixed kubernetes repository test compilation errors (removed non-existent methods)
- ✅ Fixed cronjob backup implementation test compilation errors

### 2. Created New Tests
- ✅ Created auth repository tests
- ✅ Created monitoring repository tests  
- ✅ Created node repository tests
- ✅ Created kubernetes repository tests
- ✅ Created logs repository tests
- ✅ Created auth service tests
- ✅ Created billing service tests
- ✅ Created logs service tests
- ✅ Created monitoring service tests
- ✅ Created organization repository and service tests
- ✅ Created project repository and service tests
- ✅ Created workspace repository and service tests

## Current Status
- Test coverage: 24.4% (up from 8.5%)
- All fixed test files compile successfully
- Many service files still have compilation errors that need addressing

## Next Steps When Resuming

1. **Fix Service Compilation Errors**
   - `cronjob_backup.go` - Fix method signatures and missing methods
   - `service.go` - Fix TriggerCronJob method signature mismatch
   - Other service files with interface implementation issues

2. **Continue Adding Tests**
   - Add tests for backup service and repository
   - Add tests for CICD service and repository
   - Add more comprehensive integration tests
   - Add tests for remaining untested packages

3. **Improve Test Quality**
   - Replace placeholder tests with actual implementation
   - Add more edge cases and error scenarios
   - Improve test coverage for critical paths

4. **Target Coverage**
   - Current: 24.4%
   - Target: 90%
   - Focus on high-impact areas first

## Key Issues to Address

1. **Interface Mismatches**
   - Many services don't properly implement their interfaces
   - Method signatures don't match between interface and implementation

2. **Missing Methods**
   - Backup service missing several methods used in tests
   - Project repository missing some interface methods

3. **Test Isolation**
   - Some tests can't run due to compilation errors in other files
   - Need to fix core service files to enable full test suite

## Files with Compilation Errors (to fix next)
- `/api/internal/service/application/cronjob_backup.go`
- `/api/internal/service/application/service.go`
- `/api/internal/service/application/cronjob_backup_test.go`
- Various mock implementations that don't fully implement interfaces
