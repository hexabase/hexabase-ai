# UI Development Work State

## Current Branch: `feat_ui_basic`

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Testing Infrastructure Setup
- Installed Jest, React Testing Library, and related dependencies
- Created Jest configuration with TypeScript and Next.js support
- Set up test utilities:
  - Custom render function with providers (QueryClient, AuthProvider)
  - Mock API client factory with all API methods
  - Test data factories for consistent test data generation
- Fixed duplicate declarations in api-client.ts (reduced from 3,967 to 1,377 lines)
- Created example button component tests to verify setup

### 2. Development Plan
- Created comprehensive 8-week UI development plan with TDD approach
- Defined implementation phases:
  - Phase 1: Foundation & Testing (Week 1) ✅
  - Phase 2: Application Management (Week 2-3)
  - Phase 3: Serverless Functions (Week 4-5)
  - Phase 4: AI Operations (Week 6)
  - Phase 5: Advanced Features (Week 7-8)

## Current State 🏗️

### Files Created/Modified:
- `UI_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive development roadmap
- `jest.config.ts` - Jest configuration
- `jest.setup.tsx` - Jest setup with mocks
- `__mocks__/` - Mock files for CSS and images
- `src/test-utils/` - Testing utilities and factories
- `src/components/__tests__/ui/button.test.tsx` - Example test

### Test Commands Available:
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm test:watch       # Run tests in watch mode
npm test:coverage    # Run tests with coverage report
npm test:e2e         # Run Playwright E2E tests
```

## Next Steps 📋

### Immediate (Phase 1 - Authentication):
1. **Write authentication flow tests** (TDD - Red phase)
   - Login page component tests
   - OAuth callback handler tests
   - Auth context provider tests
   - Protected route tests

2. **Implement authentication components** (Green phase)
   - Complete login page with OAuth providers
   - Implement callback handling
   - Add session management
   - Create auth guards

3. **Refactor and optimize** (Refactor phase)
   - Extract reusable auth hooks
   - Add error handling
   - Implement token refresh

### Upcoming Features Priority:
1. **High Priority**:
   - Organization management (CRUD operations)
   - Workspace creation and management
   - Project management within workspaces

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Application deployment UI
   - CronJob management
   - Function (serverless) management

3. **Low Priority**:
   - AI Operations integration
   - Advanced monitoring
   - Backup management

## Missing Core Features 🚫

Based on analysis, these features need implementation:
- **Functions/Serverless UI** - No components exist
- **Application Management** - No deployment UI
- **AI/AIOps Components** - No AI agent management
- **CI/CD Pipeline UI** - No visualization
- **Node Management** - No Proxmox integration UI

## Technical Debt 🔧
- Some components have inline mock data
- Missing error boundaries in some components
- Need loading skeletons in more areas
- Coverage thresholds temporarily set to 0%

## Testing Strategy 🧪
- Write tests FIRST (Red)
- Implement minimal code (Green)
- Refactor and optimize
- Target >90% coverage for new code
- Use factories for consistent test data
- Mock external dependencies

## Commands to Resume Work:
```bash
# Switch to the branch
git checkout feat_ui_basic

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests to verify setup
npm test

# Continue with authentication implementation
npm test:watch -- --testPathPattern=auth
```

## Environment Setup:
- Next.js with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for styling
- shadcn/ui components
- React Hook Form for forms
- Zod for validation
- React Query for server state
- Socket.io for real-time updates
