# Operations Guide

This section is designed for Infrastructure and DevOps teams responsible for deploying, maintaining, and operating Hexabase KaaS in production environments.

## In This Section

Most deployment and operations guides have been moved to the [Deployment](../deployment/) section for better organization.

### Available Here

This directory contains additional operational procedures and policies.

### Deployment Guides

For deployment-related documentation, please see:

- [Kubernetes Deployment](../deployment/kubernetes-deployment.md) - Basic Kubernetes deployment
- [Production Setup](../deployment/production-setup.md) - Production-grade deployment guide
- [Monitoring Setup](../deployment/monitoring-setup.md) - Monitoring and observability
- [Backup & Recovery](../deployment/backup-recovery.md) - Backup and disaster recovery
- [Deployment Policies](../deployment/deployment-policies.md) - Organizational policies

### Troubleshooting Guide
*Coming soon* - Common operational issues and their solutions.

## Quick Start for Operations

1. **Review prerequisites**: Check system requirements below
2. **Prepare infrastructure**: Follow [Production Setup](../deployment/production-setup.md)
3. **Deploy the platform**: Use [Kubernetes Deployment](../deployment/kubernetes-deployment.md)
