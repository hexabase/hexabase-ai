# ADR Organization Migration Summary

**Date**: 2025-06-12  
**Completed By**: Architecture Team

## Summary

Reorganized 26 ADR files from `/docs/adr/records/` into 8 comprehensive, theme-based ADRs following a consistent format.

## Migration Details

### Original Files Consolidated

1. **Platform Architecture (ADR-001)**
   - Consolidated from implementation details and architecture overview files
   - Focused on vCluster decision and multi-tenancy approach

2. **Authentication & Security (ADR-002)**
   - Merged from: OAuth implementation summary, security architecture docs
   - Comprehensive OAuth2/OIDC with PKCE documentation

3. **Function Service (ADR-003)**
   - Combined: Function service architecture, Fission migration guide, DI architecture
   - Documents evolution from Knative to Fission with provider abstraction

4. **AI Operations (ADR-004)**
   - Merged: AI agent architecture, AIOps architecture files
   - Complete AI/ML integration approach with security model

5. **CI/CD Architecture (ADR-005)**
   - Based on: CICD architecture document
   - Provider abstraction pattern for CI/CD systems

6. **Logging & Monitoring (ADR-006)**
   - From: Logging strategy document
   - ClickHouse decision and implementation details

7. **Backup & DR (ADR-007)**
   - Combined: Backup feature plan, CronJob backup integration
   - Hybrid backup approach documentation

8. **Domain-Driven Design (ADR-008)**
   - Extracted from: Structure guide and implementation patterns
   - Code organization and architectural principles

### Files Archived

The following files were moved to archive as they were redundant or outdated:
- `2025-06-01_implementation-details.md` (too verbose, content extracted)
- `2025-06-09_WORK-STATUS_OLD.md` (explicitly marked as old)
- Project management duplicates (consolidated into implementation status)
- Various work status and immediate next steps files (temporal documents)

### Key Improvements

1. **Consistent Format**: All ADRs now follow the 8-section template
2. **Clear Status**: Each ADR has implementation status clearly marked
3. **Technical Focus**: Removed project management content, focused on architecture
4. **Better Navigation**: Added comprehensive README with index
5. **Historical Context**: Preserved architectural evolution timeline

### Architecture Evolution Timeline

Based on the consolidated ADRs:

- **June 1-3**: Foundation (Platform, Security, DDD)
- **June 6-7**: Core Services (AIOps, CI/CD)  
- **June 8-9**: Operations (Functions, Logging, Backup)
- **June 10-11**: Optimization (Fission migration)

### Next Steps

1. Archive original files to `/docs/adr/archive/`
2. Update all code references to point to new ADR numbers
3. Establish review process for new ADRs
4. Create ADR template file for future use
