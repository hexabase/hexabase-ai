## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Background** - Context and problem statement
2. **Status** - Current implementation status
3. **Other options considered** - Alternative solutions evaluated
4. **What was decided** - The chosen solution
5. **Why did you choose it?** - Rationale for the decision
6. **Why didn't you choose the other option** - Reasons for rejecting alternatives
7. **What has not been decided** - Open questions and future decisions
8. **Considerations** - Implementation details, security, performance, etc.

## Architecture Evolution Timeline

### June 1-3, 2025: Foundation

- Platform architecture with vCluster
- Security architecture with OAuth2/OIDC
- Domain-driven design adoption

### June 6-7, 2025: Core Services

- AI Operations architecture
- CI/CD provider abstraction

### June 8-9, 2025: Operations & Scaling

- Function service with Fission migration
- Logging with ClickHouse
- Backup and disaster recovery

### June 10-11, 2025: Optimization

- Fission provider implementation
- Performance improvements

## Key Architectural Principles

1. **Provider Abstraction** - Avoid vendor lock-in with clean interfaces
2. **Security First** - Zero-trust, encryption, audit trails
3. **Performance Focused** - Optimize for sub-second operations
4. **Cost Effective** - Choose solutions that scale economically
5. **Domain Driven** - Clear boundaries and ownership
6. **Test Driven** - 90% coverage requirement

## Using These ADRs

- For new features, check relevant ADRs for patterns and decisions
- When proposing changes, create new ADRs following the format
- Update ADR status when implementations change
- Link to ADRs in code comments for context
