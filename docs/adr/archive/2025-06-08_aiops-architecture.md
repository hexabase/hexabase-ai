# AI-Ops Architecture - LLM Integration

**Date**: 2025-06-09  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Platform Team, AI Team  
**Tags**: ai, llm, architecture, aiops

## Context

To differentiate our platform and provide advanced automation capabilities, we decided to integrate AI/LLM capabilities for:
- Intelligent troubleshooting and debugging
- Automated code generation and deployment
- Natural language interfaces for platform operations
- Proactive monitoring and anomaly detection
- Smart resource optimization

Key requirements:
- Support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- Secure execution environment for AI-generated code
- Cost management for API usage
- Data privacy and security
- Real-time interaction capabilities

## Decision

Implement a comprehensive AI-Ops layer with:

1. **LLM Integration Layer**
   - Ollama for local model hosting (Llama, Mistral, etc.)
   - Provider abstraction for OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
   - Langfuse for LLM observability and cost tracking
   - Token usage monitoring and limits

2. **Internal Operations API**
   - Secure API for AI agents to interact with platform
   - Short-lived JWT tokens for agent authentication
   - Rate limiting and access controls
   - Comprehensive audit logging

3. **Dynamic Code Execution**
   - Knative Functions for serverless execution
   - Python SDK for AI agents
   - Automatic resource cleanup
   - Sandboxed execution environment

4. **AI Agent Framework**
   - Tool definitions for platform operations
   - Chain-of-thought prompting strategies
   - Error handling and retry logic
   - Human-in-the-loop for critical operations

## Consequences

### Positive
- Powerful automation capabilities
- Improved developer experience
- Reduced operational overhead
- Competitive differentiation
- Extensible architecture for future AI features

### Negative
- Complexity in managing AI behaviors
- Potential for unexpected AI actions
- Dependency on LLM providers
- Cost management challenges
- Security risks from AI-generated code

### Risks
- AI generating harmful or inefficient code
- Token costs exceeding budgets
- Data leakage through LLM providers
- User over-reliance on AI features
- Regulatory compliance challenges

## Alternatives Considered

1. **No AI Integration**
   - Pros: Simpler, more predictable, lower risk
   - Cons: Missing market opportunity, less automation
   - Rejected due to competitive requirements

2. **ChatOps Only (Slack/Discord bots)**
   - Pros: Simple integration, familiar interface
   - Cons: Limited capabilities, no code execution
   - Rejected as too limiting

3. **Custom ML Models Only**
   - Pros: Full control, no external dependencies
   - Cons: High development cost, limited capabilities
   - Rejected due to resource constraints

4. **Third-party AI Platforms (AutoGPT, LangChain)**
   - Pros: Rich features, active development
   - Cons: Less control, integration complexity
   - Rejected in favor of custom integration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Ollama integration
- Basic Internal Operations API
- Simple AI agent for troubleshooting

### Phase 2: Code Execution
- Python SDK development
- Knative Functions integration
- Sandboxed execution environment

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Proactive monitoring agents
- Cost optimization agents
