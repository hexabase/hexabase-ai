# Structure Compliance Update

**Date**: 2025-06-09  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

## Summary

Updated the project structure to be fully compliant with STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md rules.

## Changes Made

### 1. Moved Test Reports to Correct Location

**Issue**: Test coverage reports were incorrectly placed in `/docs/testing/coverage-reports/`

**Resolution**: Moved all test reports to `/api/testresults/coverage-reports/` as per STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md rule:
- "Test results MUST go in `/api/testresults/`"
- "Never place test reports in `/docs/`"

**Files Moved**:
- APPLICATION_API_TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md
- K3S_AGENT_STATUS_TEST_REPORT.md  
- NODE_MANAGEMENT_TEST_REPORT.md

### 2. Updated README.md Documentation Structure

**Issue**: The documentation structure in README.md showed test reports under `/docs/testing/`

**Resolution**: Updated to accurately reflect the correct structure:
- Added `/api/testresults/` section showing where ALL test results go
- Updated `/docs/testing/` description to clarify it's for "Testing guides ONLY (no results)"
- Added `/docs/implementation-summaries/` to the structure

### 3. Added Missing Links in README.md

**Completed Earlier**:
- Added link to STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md in Quick Links section
- Added references to STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md and CLAUDE.md in Contributing section

## Compliance Status

✅ **API Directory**: Test results correctly placed in `/api/testresults/`  
✅ **Docs Directory**: Contains only guides and documentation (no test results)  
✅ **README.md**: Documentation structure now accurately reflects STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md rules  
✅ **File Organization**: All files in their correct locations per project conventions

## Key Rules Enforced

From STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md:
- "Test results MUST go in `/api/testresults/`"
- "Never place test reports in `/docs/`" 
- "Only guides, references, and design docs" in `/docs/`
- "Clear separation between guides and results"

The project structure is now fully compliant with all rules defined in STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md.
