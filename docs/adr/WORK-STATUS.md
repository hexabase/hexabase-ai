   - Need to consolidate work-logs and implementation summaries
   - Decision: Adopt new ADR-based structure

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Currently at 44.2%, target is 80%
   - Need more integration tests for new features
   - Decision: Prioritize test writing in next sprint

3. **Frontend Development**
   - UI is only 25% complete
   - Need to decide on component library
   - Decision: Continue with current approach or switch framework?
